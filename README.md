# The Spark Foundation Tasks- Batch April 2022
This project was completed as part of my Data Science & Business Analytics Internship at The Sparks Foundation (GRIP April 2022 Batch). 
The objective was to create a Decision Tree Classifier and visualize it graphically as well as predicting students score based on their working hours. This task involved data preprocessing, model development using Python's scikit-learn library, and graphical visualization of the decision tree. The project provided valuable insights into the workings of decision tree algorithms and their application in business analytics, contributing to my growing in data science.
